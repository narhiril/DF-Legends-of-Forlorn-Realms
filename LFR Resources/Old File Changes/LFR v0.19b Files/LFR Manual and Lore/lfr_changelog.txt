[CLAF] v0.19b

Fixed an issue that was preventing slimers from being available on embark in certain situations.  Fixed an issue that was preventing vanguard artifacts from obeying stone stockpile settings.  
Corpses devoured by the shedim will no longer linger for an unusual (read: any) amount of time after being eaten.  Fixed a few documentation inconsistencies.  Updated the (dated) readme for 
LFR-SC.

Added a reaction to create stone barrels at the machine shop.  Added dwarven tarantulas and associated research/transcription reactions.

[CLAE] v0.19a

Fixed an issue preventing stonekin and zephyrs from being able to buff other ritual units in some cases.  The obstacle course has received a much-needed makeover.  The meowkin can now use and 
manufacture iron products.  Removed all prior material costs for ceremonial transformations - these reactions will now use "symbols" of favor, which can be obtained from new prayer reactions at 
each temple.  Added iron dwarven spiders.  Added slimers - a benign domestic creature that will be used as a transformation platform for more advanced dwarven mechanical constructs.  Removed the 
reaction to prepare the "ceremonial bath of Temanat," as it is now obsolete.  The "prayer for ritual metals" has been renamed simply to the "prayer for metals."  The "prayer for ritual gems" 
has been renamed to the "prayer for glass," and has had its products altered accordingly.  Added the Temple of Light.  Added the Temple of Shadows.  The cost for producing dwarven spider control 
modules has been reduced to require fewer lustrum rocks and capacitors.  Voidwalker mistshrouds can now block incoming debuffs 1/4th of the time.  Added lizardman mystics, which can block incoming 
debuffs as well.  Magnetic dart launcher and upgraded crossbow production reactions now use the bowyer skill instead of the weaponsmithing skill.  Magnetic dart production reactions now use the 
furnace operator skill rather than the weaponsmithing skill (same as javelins).  Fixed a few typos here and there (thanks katana for the help).  ALchemical experiments have had their number of 
reagents reduced to three, due to changes to stone availability.  Gold synthesis has had its number of reagents reduced to five for the same reasons.  Golden obelisks for the Temple of the 
Orphan have had their stone requirements lowered from ten to three.  Added an optional component to reduce the penetrating power of bolts, arrows, and blowdarts.

Added iron dwarven mantises, and associated research/transcription reactions.  Added dwarven umbrals and radiant priests.

[CLAD] v0.18e

Fixed an issue causing stone minecart and bucket reactions to erroneously use wood instead of stone (derp).  Added compatibility with DF v0.34.11.  Fixed an issue causing the orrery to produce 
(now outdated) slabs of accreditation (thanks greycat).  Updated pre-installed version to Ironhand Graphics v0.73.

[CLAC] v0.18d

Fixed an issue with rakshasa illusionary copies dropping illusionary rib bones on death.  Removed bdog's wheelbarrows and loading/unloading stations (now obsolete).  Added compatibility with 
DF v0.34.10.  Added reactions to the alchemy lab to create rainbow diamonds from certain combinations of more common gems.  Added the ability to manufacture stone wheelbarrows (stock version), 
minecarts, and buckets to the machine shop.  Updated pre-installed version to Ironhand graphics v0.72.

---

[CLAA] v0.18b

Fixed an issue where the altar of windswept earth and obelisk construction reactions were still using stones marked as economic.  Changed the way tech tier two advancement works - slabs 
of accreditation have been removed.  Training workshops will now produce a puff of harmless smoke upon a successful reaction.  Alchemical or transmutation experiments will now produce 
"experiment results."  These new items can be used in the "evaluate experiment results" reaction, where one experiment result is consumed for a chance at producing the products formerly 
produced by the "document alchemical research" reaction.  Changed the trash compactor to now be able to dispose of experiment results instead of slabs of accreditation.  Added hotkeys to 
training workshops and the alchemy lab.  Deep wolves can now recieve hunting training.  Reduced the cost for emberlight warriors.  Fixed an issue preventing players from actually being 
able to build bronze spiders (derp - thanks Jilladilla).

[CLZ] v0.18a


Added dwarven tempests.  Added the Temple of the Orphan.  Added wavebreaker and zephyr "cross-combo" abilities with tempests.  Added the ability for voidwalker mistshrouds to block this 
new combo.  Added jagged crystal dragons.  Emberlight warriors can now safely swim, stand, see, and fight in magma.  Added a new regional interaction to terrifying swamp biomes.  Added 
the (tier 4 tech) mechanized defense laboratory and associated reactions.  Added dwarven spider constructs.  Added the shedim as a new, universally hostile race.  Added priceless vanguard 
artifacts (VERY rare).  Changed "prayer for elemental ritual materials" at the Temple of the Twins to "prayer for ritual metals," and removed the gem products.  Added "prayer for ritual 
gems" to make up for this at the new Temple of the Orphan.  Cleaned up some overlapping hotkeys at the Temple of the Twins.  The fishing pond will now produce raw rainbow trout in addition 
to the "trout of Kogut" meat it already produces - percentage products have been adjusted so that yield is not much different.  The "big catch" reaction at the fishing pond is now a bit 
more worthwhile and has been given an easter egg.  The meowkin will now sell "mech parts caches" that can be "unpacked" at the new tier 4 tech building for a random assortment of related 
parts.  Added the dwarven spider deployment hub.  Added the ability to manufacture your own experimental weapons in adventure mode.  Added an underground plant that will start to appear once 
you breach the magma layer.  Revised mill/brew reactions to give them a chance to produce multiple seeds.  Removed an erroneous reaction reference to a prism star seed (does not exist). 
Added the greater demon of cowardice.  Added the rakshasa.  Added two new secrets.  Re-implemented frigid zingers.  Added ice dragons and ice wyverns.  Added shedim corpse devouring.  Added 
shedim ah kirals and ah haleels.  Added giant cannon beetles (thanks monk321654).  Fixed an issue with hellions causing them to use the wrong graphic.  Vastly simplified zinger anatomy.  
Added a new graphic for the new zinger anatomy.  Added prayers for metalcrafting and blacksmithing to the Temple of Fire (thanks Pan).  Changed the hotkey for the "prayer for industry" from 
"p" to "i."  Fixed an issue preventing watchers from reproducing.  Turning stones into gold now requires 15 stones instead of 10 (I hate to be the bearer of the nerf bat, but it really 
had to be done here).  Added a large number of graphics for vanilla creatures (BIG thanks to Meph on this one).  Fixed a typo in shedim lore file.  Removed irritating text for nephilim 
morale boosts.  Revised voidwalker anatomy.  Added two new spear types for voidwalkers.

[CLY] v0.17a

Added missing mannerism tokens to voidwalkers.  The reaction to produce "stonewall vintage" cheese at the exotic cheesery will now correctly produce dimple cup seeds in addition to its 
usual product.  Re-mapped the hotkey for the aforementioned reaction to "v."  Re-mapped the hotkey for the weapons concept lab to "x" (it was overlapping with the wood furnace).  Fixed 
an issue where the greater demon of famine's giant claw was too easily severable.  Added meowkin intermediaries (trade representatives).  Added missing IS_STONE token to vanguard rubble. 
The "create torchbearer gargoyle" reaction has been moved to the temple component foundry (it makes more sense).  Added framework for the Temple of the Orphan.  Updated LFR pre-packaged 
version to use DF v0.34.07.  Added shedim creature files and dependencies (no entity yet, still testing this).

[CLX] v0.16b

Balance tweaks: fixed an issue causing the ritual of victory to preserve its reagents.  Changed the "prayer for ritual metals" to "prayer for ritual materials," and added ritual-related gems 
as possible products.  Reverted high priests to previous settings (limit of 2, no class requirement), but left their new squad sizes intact.

[CLW] v0.16a

Fixed an issue preventing spirit binders from working properly outside of arena mode.  Added dwarven saboteurs and "watchers" - a new creature to counter them.  Added voidwalker mistshrouds.
Added the Temple of the Twins and associated reactions.  Added dwarven stonekin and zephyrs.  Added custom weather effects and a manual section to explain them.  Increased the high priest's 
squad from three members to five.  Gave bog trolls access to the felling axe.  Changed exiled rift wardens to semimegabeasts.

Added animal training savants and naturally gifted warriors (thanks Atlan) - naturally gifted warriors do not have a natural skill, but learn military skills 
much faster than normal dwarves.  Unlike all other savant castes, naturally gifted warriors CAN be used in ceremonial transformations, but will lose their enhanced learning rate, so train them 
before you transform them!

[CLV] v0.15g

Fixed an issue with a missing text file in the raw-only release.  Removed the plant requirement for building the potted plant (it was decaying and destroying the building).  Fixed an issue with 
documentation where the upgraded crossbows were erroneously referred to as dart launchers.  Significantly weakened empyrean carbuncle's hidden ability.  Significantly increased 
empyrean carbuncle's defense.  Corrosive zingers are a lot more dangerous now.  Fixed an issue preventing the metal caster from working properly.  Significantly increased the cost of 
wavebreaker transformations.

prosperity.  Added exiled rift wardens to worldgen as rare megabeasts.  Fixed an issue with Visthel's embrace that was causing it to be used by metalsmithing moods.  Fixed an issue with 
dwarf caste descriptors.  Added the ability to make wooden wheelbarrows at the machine shop.  Added the archaeologist's lab and associated reactions.  Added vanguard ruins.  Orichalcum can 
now be found in vanguard ruins in additional to its usual locations.  Fixed an issue with the graphic for the greater demon of pestilence.  Fixed an issue causing the potted plant to accept 
non-empty pots.  Removed caste-level appearance modifiers for emberlight warriors until the crash issue is resolved.  Renamed the reward from sentinel core research so as not to be confused 
with the crossbow upgrades from the tech tree.

[CLT] v0.15e


Fixed an issue causing the rare mineral cooperite to refine to cobalt instead of palladium.  Fixed an issue with metal javelin throwers requiring an obscene number of bars.  Fixed an issue 
preventing empyrean carbuncles from using their most powerful ability on their own.  Fixed an issue preventing a rare (non-savant) caste of dwarves from being able to undergo the emberlight 
warrior transformation.  Added additional framework for future creature developments.  Updated LFR for compatability with DF v0.34.04.

[CLS] v0.15d


Added missing token for allowing mithril strands to be woven into cloth.  Prayers of the armor and weapon apprentices at the temple of fire now require a ceremonial urn (preserved), which is 
made from two silver bars at the temple component foundry.  Fixed an issue causing specific brew reactions to kick out generic "drinks" instead of the alcohol they were supposed to.  Restored 
missing unlock reaction to the lustrum energy extractor.  Fixed an issue causing orichalcum precision tools not to be available at magma-powered alchemy labs.  Requirements and products for the 
greater ritual of sustinence have been changed - it now requires ash instead of a live creature, and can produce fireproof backpacks.  Cooldown for emberlight warriors' fireballs has been 
substantially reduced.  Percentage chance for emberlight warrior transformation from appropriate reaction has been increased.  Fixed an issue causing every caste of zinger to bleed acid instead 
of just the corrosive ones.  As originally intended, emberlight warriors are now immune to fire, while regular dwarves are not (UGH, most irritating bug ever).  High priests have been changed - 
dwarves must now be blessed servants of an old god before they can hold that position.  Removed the cap on the number of high priests.  Fixed a bug preventing the reaction to unlock the fishing 
pond from showing up.  Fixed a bug preventing the "crush stones" reaction from appearing at the trash compactor.  Female emberlight warriors are now sterile (no more giving birth to a very 
unfotunate baby in the midst of a conflagration).  Simplified clothing plug-in will now include shoes for dwarves only.  Fixed a graphics glitch with t+he experimental materials and weapons 
concept workshops.

Simplified clothing and Sphalerite's rare animal mini-mod are now included with both the raw-only and pre-packaged downloads (they are not installed by default).  See the readme files for those 
plug-ins for more information.

Language files have been expanded to include new words.  Removed [CANNOT_UNDEAD] from all civilized creatures and added undead graphics for them.  Fixed an error in the file for 
LFR-related shapes.  Removed [FIREIMMUNE_SUPER] from emberlight warriors (was erroneously being applied at creature-level).  Void energy projectors will now use the spear skill in 
melee and have been given a bayonet attack.

[CLQ] v0.15b

Configured LFR to run properly with the new release of Dwarf Fortress (v0.34.01).

Content and balancing: Added prayers for weapon and armor smithing at temple of fire.  Added the potted plant (thanks Deon and Meph) as a bit of tasteful decoration.  Added adventure mode 
reactions to manufacture bolts, blowdarts, and arrows.  Added specific mill reactions and brew reactions to millstone, quern, and still for each applicable plant in LFR (thank Urist Da Vinci 
and hermano).  Added the ability to extract mithril strands (thanks Meph).  Fixed an issue causing behemoths to be affected by their own syndrome.  Tortoises have been renamed to "bronze-
shelled tortoises."  Added a few easter eggs. Added the ceremonial pyre reaction to the temple of fire.  Restored previosuly removed pyrophoric zingers.  Dwarves will now engrave images of 
the Old Gods.  Emberlight warriors have been added.  Buffed empyrean carbuncles slightly.

File structure: Split changelog/version hitory from the manual - it now has its own file (lfr_changelog.txt).  Pigeons (only standard pigeons) have been moved to creature_narhiril.txt, 
and should no longer be percieved as hostiles by your military.  Split descriptor_shape_narhiril.txt into two files, the other being descriptor_shape_easter_egg.txt, and moved appropriate 
entries.  Greater demons will now use the new graphics_z_demon_lfr.txt file for their sprites.

[CLP] v0.15a

Fixed a typo in the description for megalania.  Added a new easter egg creature (this thing is vicious, just warning you guys, but you'll have to go a bit out of the way to find it).  
Fixed an issue with incubi that was causing them to be much rarer than intended.  Fixed a bug related to vines of xanadu returning a bugged (null) mill product. Vines of xanadu will now 
produce "heavenly seasoning" when milled, which carries a material value of 20.  Nephilim will now use heraldic shields in addition to their previous two types (this change is mostly cosmetic).  
Added the ability to craft hadrine reactive shields (same prerequisites as other hadrine pieces).  Alchemical experiments now have a small (5%) chance of producing a lustrum rock.  Added 
savant castes for glassmakers.  Zinger anatomy has been vastly simplified.  Added corrosive zingers.  Removed a redundant extra "document efficient casting procedure" reaction.  A certain type of 
pigeon is now substantially less common, and will use a unique graphic.  Stock whips have been beaten with the nerf bat of justice and will no longer offer ridiculous armor penetration, which 
didn't make any sense anyway.  The trash compactor can now be used to remove slabs of accreditation - unlike documentation, this reaction uses no skill and creates no product, it is purely for 
disposal of unwanted slabs once things are unlocked.  Creatures have had their background colors removed, which should make the unit screen a bit easier to look at.  Plants in ASCII version have 
had background colors removed.  Minerals and metals in ASCII version have had their background colors removed.  Artwork for the experimental materials workshop, shrine of nature, shrine of 
victory, shrine of prosperity, mechanical obstacle course, medical training dummy, and weapons concept labs has been revised.  Nephilim will no longer send caravans or diplomats during the spring.
Terminated "support" for Phoebus' graphic set until I can more adequately get it to work properly.  Meowkin have had their adult size slightly increased.

Added a good amount of documentation for the tech and ritual trees, found in the lfr manual and lore folder.  The tech tree and ritual tree now have their own dedicated manuals and/or reference 
sheets.  Tier three of the tech tree has a guide on how to fully utilize the new features.

Tier three of the tech tree has been implemented.  The full changelog for this is so enormous that it would fill most of the screen, so I'll try to paraphrase.  Added buildings: the advanced 
alchemy lab, the prototype workbench, the scientific library, the exotic cheesery.  Weapons upgrades - the dwarves can perform research at the advanced alchemy lab to unlock upgrades to the 
crossbow and a new weapon entirely.  Weapon upgrades can create formidable hybrid weapons, which are capable of great power in both ranged and melee combat. The magnetic dart launcher can be 
researched, unlocked, and then upgraded alongside the crossbow. Ammo for the magnetic dart launcher can be manufactured from certain metals in stacks of 60. Advanced alchemy experiments - the 
bigger, meaner cousin of the alchemical experiments of old.  New risks, new rewards. Advanced transmutation experiments, to much more reliably grant access to rare plants. Added the ability to 
manufacture a potent knockout gas from voracious maws at the advanced alchemy lab. Added new methods for creating cheese. In case you missed any tier two advances on the way to tier three, 
the scientific library can unlock them for you.  Of course, added new easter eggs.

[CLO] v0.14e

Added the Greater Demon of Famine.  Strengthened the claws and/or horns of a few spoiler-related creatures.  Revised the syndromes on a spoiler-related creature.  
Empyrean carbuncles will no longer pose a friendly fire risk to other common war animals.  Removed a duplicate description token from certain castes of carbuncles.
Nephilim will no longer fly - instead, they will move at enhanced speeds as a sort of "limited flight capability."  As a result, nephilim caravans will now trade 
their goods with the dwarves.  Lore has been modified to accomodate this change.  Fixed a bug causing adamantine javelins at the advanced casters to require more 
bars than intended.  White gold can now be used for advanced mechanisms.  Added "perform mock autopsy" reaction to the morgue (trains diagnostics).  Vermin autopsy 
will now advance diagnostics significantly more (2x).  Zingers are now substantially less common in the wild to minimize their impact on fortresses who rely on 
underground fauna for hunting.  Added pygmy anyklosaurs as a new trainable war beast (thanks Imp for the concept).  The material value of rainbow diamonds has been
reduced (approx 1/2) due to increased availability (they're still quite valuable though :D).  A bug causing lizardmen to periodically use voidshard has been fixed
(thanks Jilladilla).  Many LFR-related megabeasts have been given tougher hides and/or scales.  Added megalania.  Added a small number of new easter eggs.  Deep 
wolves are now substantially more common.

[CLN] v0.14d

Fixed a bug causing the fish pond to kick out generic "raw fish" items.  Added the grazer token to pegasoi.  Fixed a bug causing items made from ritual materials not
to stockpile properly - they are now considered "wood" products from a technical standpoint.  Fixed a bug causing the machine shop to create bins and beds of clay.
Fishing pond speed has been significantly increased.  Added shedim lore file.  Added several easter eggs of varying complexity.  Added framework for upcoming ritual
and mechanical advances.  Revised the appearance of the temple of fire.  The alchemy lab, weapons concept lab, magma-powered weapons concept lab, and magma-powered
alchemy lab are now listed as furnaces on the build menu (previously listed as workshops).  Fixed an issue with the weapons concept labs causing the labrys to never
be produced (thanks 73).  Hadrine meshes no longer carry a quality modifier (reason: absurd values for an intermediate item).  Fixed a bug causing the temple of fire
to require any "tool" item to construct.  Fixed a bug causing a spoiler-relate creature not to drop the proper item on death.  Tweaked the attributes and lethality
of a certain spoiler-related creature.  Added a small bit of lore for the previously mentioned spoiler-related creature.  Added manual entries for the shrine reactions
(somehow I forgot these in 0.14c).  Dwarves will no longer seek out LFR-related slabs for decoration (memorial slabs are unaffected).  The prayers for fortune and
celebration have been moved to the shrine of prosperity (they were erroneously located at the shrine of victory).  Damascus sentinels can now be killed by shattering
the "control module" located in their head.  You will still need to penetrate the outer plating to do this, but this will make them more easily killable with blunt or 
piercing weapons (previously, you had to cut the head or lower body off to kill them).  Flying cave oyster pearls are no longer considered inorganic, and will no longer 
appear in the stone stockpile list.  Appearances of display cases and hadrine meshes have been changed to avoid confusion with corpses.  Fixed a bug with the trash 
compactor causing one of the "reduce clutter" reactions to call for the wrong item.  Added reactions for adamantine javelins.  Revised wording of javelin casting reactions 
to help distinguish between the different casters on the manager screen.  Fixed a bug causing a spoiler-related creature to spawn in the wrong cavern layer (thanks 73). 
Crystalline blocks are now a bit heavier.  Devourers of the depths can now be stunned.

[CLM] v0.14c

Fixed a bug that was preventing transmutation and flashbang zingers' blind effects from working properly.  Clutch size for tortoises has been substantially reduced.  Excess
clutter (gamelog, bmps) has been removed from the pre-packaged version.  Fixed a bug causing lead hammerhead javelins not to show up at the non-magma advanced metal caster.  
The rituals of power have had the number of reagents reduced from "3 and 8" to "1 and 3." Added a "crush stone" reaction to the trash compactor (see that entry for details) 
as yet another stone sink.  Plant transmutation now uses six seeds instead of eight random plants - as a result, products will no longer be consumed immediately after being 
produced when multiple copies of this reaction are queued.  Tortoises now cost a more reasonable amount of embark points (this was absurdly low in previous versions).  Added 
the "high priest" position (two possible).  Added the machine shop, a new tier one mechanical workshop (see that entry for details).  Local legends may now make a single demand.  
Added NO_STONE_STOCKPILE to the template for stones which evaporate on creation (alchemy byproducts, etc).  All appropriate LFR-related creatures now have sounds associated 
with them (for adventure mode).  Fixed a number of minor bits of erroneous text.  High priests and local legends are not duty bound - they can join you in adventure mode 
(this is intentional).  Added rituals and prayer reactions to shrines.  Added the first tier two "hybrid" building, the temple of fire, and an associated reaction.  The
temple of fire currently uses a modified orrery visual design - this will be revised (read: gutted and replaced by something cooler) in future versions.

[CLL] v0.14b

Fixed a bug that was causing the dwarven caravan to carry ether bars.  Cleaned up a few inconsistencies in documentation for the mod.  Renamed the reward for the "banshee
funeral rite" reaction to avoid confusion with ether metal.  The "melt ethereal spheres" reaction at the smelter no longer requires fuel and has had its function changed
to convert an ethereal sphere into a base-quality "ethereal sphere (processed)," which can then be melted down towards ethereal bars (special thanks to TehNoob for this 
reaction).  The crystal growth tank now requires two clear glass boxes to construct (instead of a barrel).  Fixed a few minor text errors in reactions and manual.

[CLK] v0.14a

Added bismuth bars as a possible result from alchemy.  Removed grazer tags from carbuncles and tortoises.  Added the orrery, a new training workshop.  Added 
the trash compactor and "slab removal" reactions.  Meowkin ears are now properly sized, and their litter sizes have been cut to 1-2 (was 1-3) in order to put a dent  
in their domination during world gen (they were killing absolutely everything, likely due to numbers).  Added the crystal growth tank, a tier three mechanical building.
Moved amaroks, leviathans, wyverns, behemoths, manticores, and dragons to a new material template with stronger bone and leather (this change was also applied
to a few spoiler-related creatures).  Leather and bone products of these creatures will be significantly stronger and more valuable.  Added a reaction to turn
masterwork ethereal spheres into ethereal bars without producing a tantrum spiral (found at smelter).  Added v0.03a of "zingers" raws.  Added tier one of the 
ritual tech tree and framework for tier two.  Voidwalkers will now siege from stealth - sneaky buggers.  All accumulated wealth and trade siege triggers 
have been moved one notch back to compensate for the added material value of tech and ritual tree goods.  The "perform banshee funeral rite" reaction has been
moved from the alchemy lab to the altar, and the fuel requirement for this reaction has been removed (the magma version of this reaction has also been removed).
Zingers and sabre-toothed tigers are now available on embark due to popular demand - values have been adjusted accordingly.  Added a handful of easter eggs.
Added a small number of new food items (for no good reason, possibly due to hunger at the time).  Added the fish pond, the first "hybrid" building.  A rare
caste ofpigeon will no longer appear in siege forces.

Added nephilim and meowkin diplomats.  Added carbuncles, a new common domestic creature.  Added dwarven savants - more details on this later.
Added the second tier of the "tech tree," including five new buildings and lots of associated reactions.  Added new easter eggs.  Added new
graphics for relevant creatures.  Added the moroii, a new underground tribal race.  Added rare drops for more creatures.  Moved bog troll
siege trigger back slightly.  Took the opportunity to fix a bug with kobolds that was causing them to starve to death by year 4 of worldgen.
It is now possible for players to purchase tame tortoises at embark.  Pet value for tortoises has been adjusted for this purpose.  Added amaroks 
and humbabas.  Added jackalopes and sabre-toothed tigers.  Added a caste of lizardmen which carry mischievious behavior tokens.  Removed a 
special caste of pigeons from the arena spawn list.  Resolved an issue causing widow's tears to appear as black squares.  Added weapons and
graphics for voidwalker thieves.

[CLG] v0.12b

Resolved a bug where bog trolls and voidwalkers were ignoring their siege triggers.  Fixed a typo with the name of a spoiler-related item.  Fixed an unintended
"feature" of will o' wisps that was causing nearby enemies to burn to death.  Added will o' wisp rare drops and an alchemical reaction to use them.  Added a
rare drop to masters of locusts.  Removed previously mentioned diplomatic changes for bog trolls and voidwalkers (but not for nephilim).  Removed the broken
"cremate corpse" reaction due to a broken token (hah, the rhymed) - this may be re-implemented in the future.  Autopsy reactions will now use vermin remains.
Added one new mood weapon (this one's awesome, but I'm not sharing any more about it).  Voidwalker, bog troll, and lizardman sieges and ambushes will no longer
enter the map in autumn.

[CLF] v0.12a

Resolved a few minor anomalies.  Added numerous language files.  Added mechanical-themed first installment of the "tech tree," including
six new buildings and associated reactions.  Added orichalcum.  Added new easter eggs.  Nephilim caravans will not trade with you, but you
can still offer them tribute or forcibly take their goods.  Bog trolls are not hostile to lizardmen or goblins, but will no longer send ambushes and will 
now only use wooden weapons (they are meant to be a first-tier enemy).  Voidwalkers will now siege at population 110 (down from 150, for lower system specs).  If
you create a LOT of wealth, they may come earlier.  Voidwalker will no longer abuse bodies (they have better things to do) and no longer ignore neutrals.

(pause for breath)

Fixed an issue that was making incubi much rarer than intended (though they're still pretty rare).  Added some other hidden features, including a preview of 
the second tier of the tech tree.  Fixed an issue preventing a spoiler-related creature, pigeons, and will o' wisps from spawning.  Fixed an issue with 
voidwalker graphics tiles being slightly misaligned.  Slightly brightened voidwalker graphics tiles to make them more visible on dark backgrounds.

[CLE] v0.11c

Fixed a bug preventing damascus sentinels from spawning properly during worldgen.  Tweaked new civilizations - Nephilim are no
longer hostile by default (unless they declare war on you).  Bog Trolls will now send abductors rather than just item thieves.
Names and symbols used by civilizations have been changed.  Dwarven names have been changed for dwarfier epithets.  Bog trolls should now
attack goblins and lizardmen.  Voidwalkers should now attack everything.

Various minor bug/quirk fixes (thanks Jeoshua).  Added LFR_ASCII folder - better support for this version is planned in the future.  Added some unique profession
names to mod-related civilized races.  Added pigeons.  Added new mood weapons.  Added pre-installed version for Ironhand's graphics set (thanks Ult1mara).  Pre-
installed versions for other graphics sets are planned.  Added plant transmutation reaction to alchemy lab.  Added graphics for new creatures.  Added magma versions

[CL9] v0.10a

First public release on Bay12 forums.  Fixed a bug with sentinel core research reaction that was preventing the products from showing up.  Added meowkin
merchant guards.  Tweaked bog troll and voidwalker ethics.  Changed the unpicked color of mousebulb to yellow to differentiate from bluebells (oversight).
Finalized entity lore files.  Tweaked lizardmen to make them show up more often (they were starting in a relatively rare biome not present in all worlds).
Re-introduced ether, which is now produced as an item that must be melted to obtain an ethereal bar (this *should* resolve the caravan problem).  Resolved
an issue with state names of ether.  Tweaked bog trolls to make them show up slightly later.  Made tortoises appear more frequently.  Added preliminary support 
for Phoebus' graphics set.  Support for default (ascii) and Mayday's graphics sets planned.

Ethereal spheres are now produced in batches of ten, as melting was requiring ten of them to produce a single bar.  Getting ten of an item with a 1% chance
of production was ridiculous, so I've adjusted this to make an ethereal sphere production more of an exciting moment.

Syndromes from alchemical reactions now last longer.  While this will not make much of a difference for most reactions, it will make the rare chemical
burns much more dangerous (previously, dwarves were recovering too quickly for the syndrome to cause many problems).

Javelins have been moved to a new building, the metal caster, with associated reactions.

The land mover, a new megabeast, has been added.

Note: Because of difficulties with diplomatic relations, voidwalkers carry the [ITEM_THIEF] token, meaning that a lone voidwalker will periodically show up
(stealthed) and try to steal something.  This is inconsistent with the lore files, which imply that the voidwalkers have nothing to gain from stealing dwarven
stuff, but I needed a token that would force hostilities.  Think of it as the voidwalkers wanting to keep an eye on the other races.

[CL8] v0.07b-e

Internal testing versions.  Too many files modified (and many later reverted) for a list to be terribly helpful.  Changelog will be posted for next version.

[CL7] v0.07a

Added the long-overdue graphics for voidwalkers.  Added child graphics to meowkin and lizardmen.  Added two new reactions to alchemy lab.
Pre-production is now complete.  This version will undergo a little more testing before being released as v0.10.

Ether, unfortunately, is showing up in caravans a lot more often than intended.  The importing of large quantities of this metal are limited by its extremely
high value, but seeing every dwarf merchant stride in with an entire company of ethereal spears is detrimental to the mod's intentions and immersion factor.
Until this is resolved, I am removing the ethereal bar from the possible results of alchemical experiments.

Added alchemy and associated files.  Added banshees and will o' wisps.  Added Kipi's block factory (renamed "foundry") and display case.
Added nephilim graphics.  Tweaked a few frequency values for creatures.  Added new noble position and graphics for bog trolls.  Moved a
spoiler-related creature to the creature_easter_egg.txt file (from creature_legendary_narhiril.txt).  Added a spoiler-related new helmet.  
Added graphics for all non-entity creatures.  Removed placeholder graphics for all creatures that used them.

[CL5] v0.05

Fixed a bug with lizardmen and bog trolls that was causing them to die out during worldgen.  Lizardmen can now breathe underwater as well.
Nephilim will now build castles in adventure mode.  Axes and associated graphics have been added to lizardmen and meowkin to allow them to
cut wood for fuel.  Added a new creature, the master of locusts.  Added stones and metal associated with alchemy (will have no effect without
alchemy lab, which will be in the next version).  Updated to compatability with DF v0.31.25.
