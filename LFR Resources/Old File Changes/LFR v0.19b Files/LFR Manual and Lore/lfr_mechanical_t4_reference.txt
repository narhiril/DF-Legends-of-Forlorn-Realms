A quick reference guide to the more complex armor upgrade and construct creation reactions in LFR's tech tree.  This file is provided to assist those of you who are in tier four and up, as the 
game does not do a particularly good job of letting you know exactly how many resources are required for each reaction.

For more information on the tech tree, including earier tiers, consult the lfr_mechanical_tech_tree.txt file.

[B1] MECHANIZED DEFENSE LABORATORY

This building is the main hub for mechanized construct development and assembly.  Its reactions are to fabricate mechanized construct components, assemble most mechanized constructs, 
research new types of construct, and search through imported parts caches for viable construction components.


Requirements:

Four capacitors
A sorting algorithm
Two catalytic converters
Three advanced mechanisms
A precision tool kit
A table
A chair
An anvil



Reactions:

Search cache for viable construction components - takes a mech parts cache, can produce random parts and components used in constructs.
Fabricate bronze spider chassis - takes 2 bronze bars, produces a bronze spider chassis.
Fabricate iron spider chassis - takes 2 iron bars, produces an iron spider chassis.
Fabricate steel spider chassis - takes 2 steel bars, produces a steel spider chassis.
Fabricate mithril spider chassis - takes 2 mithril bars, produces a mithril spider chassis.
Fabricate spider control module - takes a copper bar, two advanced mechanisms, two capacitors, and two lustrum rocks, produces a spider control module.
Fabricate mechanical spider eye - takes a copper bar, two advanced mechanisms, and a piece of raw clear glass, produces a mechanical spider eye.
Assemble bronze spider deployment kit - takes a mechanical spider eye, spider control module, bronze pipe section, and bronze spider chassis, produces a bronze spider deployment kit.
Assemble iron spider deployment kit - takes a mechanical spider eye, spider control module, iron pipe section, and iron spider chassis, produces an iron spider deployment kit.
Fabricate iron mantis chassis - takes 2 iron bars and 2 iron bayonets, produces an iron mantis chassis.

Assemble iron mantis (requires a nearby slimer) - takes a mechanical spider eye, an iron mantis chassis, 3 capacitors, 1 lustrum rock, 2 iron pipes, and a mantis schematic.  
						  Upon success, turns a nearby slimer into an iron dwarven mantis*.

Assemble steel tarantula (requires a nearby slimer) - takes a mechanical spider eye, a steel spider chassis, 3 capacitors, 1 lustrum rock, 2 steel pipes, and a tarantula schematic.  
						      Upon success, turns a nearby slimer into a steel dwarven tarantula*.

Assemble mithril tarantula (requires a nearby slimer) - takes a mechanical spider eye, a mithril spider chassis, 3 capacitors, 1 lustrum rock, 4 mithril pipes, and a tarantula schematic.  
						        Upon success, turns a nearby slimer into a mithril dwarven tarantula*.

Develop dwarven mantis schematics - takes an iron mantis chassis (preserved), two rock or metal pipes (preserved), two bayonets (preserved), an iron bar, and a tanned hide.   
				    Produces (90% chance) an apprentice's tome on mechanical constructs, which is used at the scientific library to create mantis schematics.

Develop dwarven tarantula schematics - takes two iron spider chassis (preserved), four rock or metal pipes (preserved), three steel bars, three mithril bars, a tanned hide, and 
				       an apprentice's tome on mechanical constructs (preserved).  Produces (80% chance) a journeyman's tome on mechanical constructs, which 
				       is used at the scientific library to create tarantula schematics.

*NOTE: this reaction is not always successful (due to the unreliable nature of inhaled syndromes).

[B2] DWARVEN SPIDER DEPLOYMENT HUB

This building is used as a base for assembling and stationing spiders.  It should be placed where you want to set up a spider swarm, as spiders cannot be penned/pastured.


Requirements:

One capacitor


Reactions:

Assemble bronze spider - takes a bronze spider deployment kit, produces a dwarven bronze spider*.
Assemble iron spider - takes an iron spider deployment kit, produces a dwarven iron spider*.

*NOTE: this reaction cannot be successfully performed by a dwarf with an active transformation (i.e. any ritual units).  Bear this in mind when you choose your mechanic!
*NOTE: this reaction is not always successful (due to the unreliable nature of inhaled syndromes).
