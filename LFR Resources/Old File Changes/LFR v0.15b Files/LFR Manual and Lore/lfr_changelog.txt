[CLx] v0.yz


--

[CLQ] v0.15b

Configured LFR to run properly with the new release of Dwarf Fortress (v0.34.01).

Content and balancing: Added prayers for weapon and armor smithing at temple of fire.  Added the potted plant (thanks Deon and Meph) as a bit of tasteful decoration.  Added adventure mode 
reactions to manufacture bolts, blowdarts, and arrows.  Added specific mill reactions and brew reactions to millstone, quern, and still for each applicable plant in LFR (thank Urist Da Vinci 
and hermano).  Added the ability to extract mithril strands (thanks Meph).  Fixed an issue causing behemoths to be affected by their own syndrome.  Tortoises have been renamed to "bronze-
shelled tortoises."  Added a few easter eggs. Added the ceremonial pyre reaction to the temple of fire.  Restored previosuly removed pyrophoric zingers.  Dwarves will now engrave images of 
the Old Gods.  Emberlight warriors have been added.  Buffed empyrean carbuncles slightly.

File structure: Split changelog/version hitory from the manual - it now has its own file (lfr_changelog.txt).  Pigeons (only standard pigeons) have been moved to creature_narhiril.txt, 
and should no longer be percieved as hostiles by your military.  Split descriptor_shape_narhiril.txt into two files, the other being descriptor_shape_easter_egg.txt, and moved appropriate 
entries.  Greater demons will now use the new graphics_z_demon_lfr.txt file for their sprites.

[CLP] v0.15a

Fixed a typo in the description for megalania.  Added a new easter egg creature (this thing is vicious, just warning you guys, but you'll have to go a bit out of the way to find it).  
Fixed an issue with incubi that was causing them to be much rarer than intended.  Fixed a bug related to vines of xanadu returning a bugged (null) mill product. Vines of xanadu will now 
produce "heavenly seasoning" when milled, which carries a material value of 20.  Nephilim will now use heraldic shields in addition to their previous two types (this change is mostly cosmetic).  
Added the ability to craft hadrine reactive shields (same prerequisites as other hadrine pieces).  Alchemical experiments now have a small (5%) chance of producing a lustrum rock.  Added 
savant castes for glassmakers.  Zinger anatomy has been vastly simplified.  Added corrosive zingers.  Removed a redundant extra "document efficient casting procedure" reaction.  A certain type of 
pigeon is now substantially less common, and will use a unique graphic.  Stock whips have been beaten with the nerf bat of justice and will no longer offer ridiculous armor penetration, which 
didn't make any sense anyway.  The trash compactor can now be used to remove slabs of accreditation - unlike documentation, this reaction uses no skill and creates no product, it is purely for 
disposal of unwanted slabs once things are unlocked.  Creatures have had their background colors removed, which should make the unit screen a bit easier to look at.  Plants in ASCII version have 
had background colors removed.  Minerals and metals in ASCII version have had their background colors removed.  Artwork for the experimental materials workshop, shrine of nature, shrine of 
victory, shrine of prosperity, mechanical obstacle course, medical training dummy, and weapons concept labs has been revised.  Nephilim will no longer send caravans or diplomats during the spring.
Terminated "support" for Phoebus' graphic set until I can more adequately get it to work properly.  Meowkin have had their adult size slightly increased.

Added a good amount of documentation for the tech and ritual trees, found in the lfr manual and lore folder.  The tech tree and ritual tree now have their own dedicated manuals and/or reference 
sheets.  Tier three of the tech tree has a guide on how to fully utilize the new features.

Tier three of the tech tree has been implemented.  The full changelog for this is so enormous that it would fill most of the screen, so I'll try to paraphrase.  Added buildings: the advanced 
alchemy lab, the prototype workbench, the scientific library, the exotic cheesery.  Weapons upgrades - the dwarves can perform research at the advanced alchemy lab to unlock upgrades to the 
crossbow and a new weapon entirely.  Weapon upgrades can create formidable hybrid weapons, which are capable of great power in both ranged and melee combat. The magnetic dart launcher can be 
researched, unlocked, and then upgraded alongside the crossbow. Ammo for the magnetic dart launcher can be manufactured from certain metals in stacks of 60. Advanced alchemy experiments - the 
bigger, meaner cousin of the alchemical experiments of old.  New risks, new rewards. Advanced transmutation experiments, to much more reliably grant access to rare plants. Added the ability to 
manufacture a potent knockout gas from voracious maws at the advanced alchemy lab. Added new methods for creating cheese. In case you missed any tier two advances on the way to tier three, 
the scientific library can unlock them for you.  Of course, added new easter eggs.

[CLO] v0.14e

Added the Greater Demon of Famine.  Strengthened the claws and/or horns of a few spoiler-related creatures.  Revised the syndromes on a spoiler-related creature.  
Empyrean carbuncles will no longer pose a friendly fire risk to other common war animals.  Removed a duplicate description token from certain castes of carbuncles.
Nephilim will no longer fly - instead, they will move at enhanced speeds as a sort of "limited flight capability."  As a result, nephilim caravans will now trade 
their goods with the dwarves.  Lore has been modified to accomodate this change.  Fixed a bug causing adamantine javelins at the advanced casters to require more 
bars than intended.  White gold can now be used for advanced mechanisms.  Added "perform mock autopsy" reaction to the morgue (trains diagnostics).  Vermin autopsy 
will now advance diagnostics significantly more (2x).  Zingers are now substantially less common in the wild to minimize their impact on fortresses who rely on 
underground fauna for hunting.  Added pygmy anyklosaurs as a new trainable war beast (thanks Imp for the concept).  The material value of rainbow diamonds has been
reduced (approx 1/2) due to increased availability (they're still quite valuable though :D).  A bug causing lizardmen to periodically use voidshard has been fixed
(thanks Jilladilla).  Many LFR-related megabeasts have been given tougher hides and/or scales.  Added megalania.  Added a small number of new easter eggs.  Deep 
wolves are now substantially more common.

[CLN] v0.14d

Fixed a bug causing the fish pond to kick out generic "raw fish" items.  Added the grazer token to pegasoi.  Fixed a bug causing items made from ritual materials not
to stockpile properly - they are now considered "wood" products from a technical standpoint.  Fixed a bug causing the machine shop to create bins and beds of clay.
Fishing pond speed has been significantly increased.  Added shedim lore file.  Added several easter eggs of varying complexity.  Added framework for upcoming ritual
and mechanical advances.  Revised the appearance of the temple of fire.  The alchemy lab, weapons concept lab, magma-powered weapons concept lab, and magma-powered
alchemy lab are now listed as furnaces on the build menu (previously listed as workshops).  Fixed an issue with the weapons concept labs causing the labrys to never
be produced (thanks 73).  Hadrine meshes no longer carry a quality modifier (reason: absurd values for an intermediate item).  Fixed a bug causing the temple of fire
to require any "tool" item to construct.  Fixed a bug causing a spoiler-relate creature not to drop the proper item on death.  Tweaked the attributes and lethality
of a certain spoiler-related creature.  Added a small bit of lore for the previously mentioned spoiler-related creature.  Added manual entries for the shrine reactions
(somehow I forgot these in 0.14c).  Dwarves will no longer seek out LFR-related slabs for decoration (memorial slabs are unaffected).  The prayers for fortune and
celebration have been moved to the shrine of prosperity (they were erroneously located at the shrine of victory).  Damascus sentinels can now be killed by shattering
the "control module" located in their head.  You will still need to penetrate the outer plating to do this, but this will make them more easily killable with blunt or 
piercing weapons (previously, you had to cut the head or lower body off to kill them).  Flying cave oyster pearls are no longer considered inorganic, and will no longer 
appear in the stone stockpile list.  Appearances of display cases and hadrine meshes have been changed to avoid confusion with corpses.  Fixed a bug with the trash 
compactor causing one of the "reduce clutter" reactions to call for the wrong item.  Added reactions for adamantine javelins.  Revised wording of javelin casting reactions 
to help distinguish between the different casters on the manager screen.  Fixed a bug causing a spoiler-related creature to spawn in the wrong cavern layer (thanks 73). 
Crystalline blocks are now a bit heavier.  Devourers of the depths can now be stunned.

[CLM] v0.14c

Fixed a bug that was preventing transmutation and flashbang zingers' blind effects from working properly.  Clutch size for tortoises has been substantially reduced.  Excess
clutter (gamelog, bmps) has been removed from the pre-packaged version.  Fixed a bug causing lead hammerhead javelins not to show up at the non-magma advanced metal caster.  
The rituals of power have had the number of reagents reduced from "3 and 8" to "1 and 3." Added a "crush stone" reaction to the trash compactor (see that entry for details) 
as yet another stone sink.  Plant transmutation now uses six seeds instead of eight random plants - as a result, products will no longer be consumed immediately after being 
produced when multiple copies of this reaction are queued.  Tortoises now cost a more reasonable amount of embark points (this was absurdly low in previous versions).  Added 
the "high priest" position (two possible).  Added the machine shop, a new tier one mechanical workshop (see that entry for details).  Local legends may now make a single demand.  
Added NO_STONE_STOCKPILE to the template for stones which evaporate on creation (alchemy byproducts, etc).  All appropriate LFR-related creatures now have sounds associated 
with them (for adventure mode).  Fixed a number of minor bits of erroneous text.  High priests and local legends are not duty bound - they can join you in adventure mode 
(this is intentional).  Added rituals and prayer reactions to shrines.  Added the first tier two "hybrid" building, the temple of fire, and an associated reaction.  The
temple of fire currently uses a modified orrery visual design - this will be revised (read: gutted and replaced by something cooler) in future versions.

[CLL] v0.14b

Fixed a bug that was causing the dwarven caravan to carry ether bars.  Cleaned up a few inconsistencies in documentation for the mod.  Renamed the reward for the "banshee
funeral rite" reaction to avoid confusion with ether metal.  The "melt ethereal spheres" reaction at the smelter no longer requires fuel and has had its function changed
to convert an ethereal sphere into a base-quality "ethereal sphere (processed)," which can then be melted down towards ethereal bars (special thanks to TehNoob for this 
reaction).  The crystal growth tank now requires two clear glass boxes to construct (instead of a barrel).  Fixed a few minor text errors in reactions and manual.

[CLK] v0.14a

Added bismuth bars as a possible result from alchemy.  Removed grazer tags from carbuncles and tortoises.  Added the orrery, a new training workshop.  Added 
the trash compactor and "slab removal" reactions.  Meowkin ears are now properly sized, and their litter sizes have been cut to 1-2 (was 1-3) in order to put a dent  
in their domination during world gen (they were killing absolutely everything, likely due to numbers).  Added the crystal growth tank, a tier three mechanical building.
Moved amaroks, leviathans, wyverns, behemoths, manticores, and dragons to a new material template with stronger bone and leather (this change was also applied
to a few spoiler-related creatures).  Leather and bone products of these creatures will be significantly stronger and more valuable.  Added a reaction to turn
masterwork ethereal spheres into ethereal bars without producing a tantrum spiral (found at smelter).  Added v0.03a of "zingers" raws.  Added tier one of the 
ritual tech tree and framework for tier two.  Voidwalkers will now siege from stealth - sneaky buggers.  All accumulated wealth and trade siege triggers 
have been moved one notch back to compensate for the added material value of tech and ritual tree goods.  The "perform banshee funeral rite" reaction has been
moved from the alchemy lab to the altar, and the fuel requirement for this reaction has been removed (the magma version of this reaction has also been removed).
Zingers and sabre-toothed tigers are now available on embark due to popular demand - values have been adjusted accordingly.  Added a handful of easter eggs.
Added a small number of new food items (for no good reason, possibly due to hunger at the time).  Added the fish pond, the first "hybrid" building.  A rare
caste ofpigeon will no longer appear in siege forces.

[CLI] v0.13a

Added nephilim and meowkin diplomats.  Added carbuncles, a new common domestic creature.  Added dwarven savants - more details on this later.
Added the second tier of the "tech tree," including five new buildings and lots of associated reactions.  Added new easter eggs.  Added new
graphics for relevant creatures.  Added the moroii, a new underground tribal race.  Added rare drops for more creatures.  Moved bog troll
siege trigger back slightly.  Took the opportunity to fix a bug with kobolds that was causing them to starve to death by year 4 of worldgen.
It is now possible for players to purchase tame tortoises at embark.  Pet value for tortoises has been adjusted for this purpose.  Added amaroks 
and humbabas.  Added jackalopes and sabre-toothed tigers.  Added a caste of lizardmen which carry mischievious behavior tokens.  Removed a 
special caste of pigeons from the arena spawn list.  Resolved an issue causing widow's tears to appear as black squares.  Added weapons and
graphics for voidwalker thieves.

[CLG] v0.12b

Resolved a bug where bog trolls and voidwalkers were ignoring their siege triggers.  Fixed a typo with the name of a spoiler-related item.  Fixed an unintended
"feature" of will o' wisps that was causing nearby enemies to burn to death.  Added will o' wisp rare drops and an alchemical reaction to use them.  Added a
rare drop to masters of locusts.  Removed previously mentioned diplomatic changes for bog trolls and voidwalkers (but not for nephilim).  Removed the broken
"cremate corpse" reaction due to a broken token (hah, the rhymed) - this may be re-implemented in the future.  Autopsy reactions will now use vermin remains.
Added one new mood weapon (this one's awesome, but I'm not sharing any more about it).  Voidwalker, bog troll, and lizardman sieges and ambushes will no longer
enter the map in autumn.

[CLF] v0.12a

Resolved a few minor anomalies.  Added numerous language files.  Added mechanical-themed first installment of the "tech tree," including
six new buildings and associated reactions.  Added orichalcum.  Added new easter eggs.  Nephilim caravans will not trade with you, but you
can still offer them tribute or forcibly take their goods.  Bog trolls are not hostile to lizardmen or goblins, but will no longer send ambushes and will 
now only use wooden weapons (they are meant to be a first-tier enemy).  Voidwalkers will now siege at population 110 (down from 150, for lower system specs).  If
you create a LOT of wealth, they may come earlier.  Voidwalker will no longer abuse bodies (they have better things to do) and no longer ignore neutrals.

(pause for breath)

Fixed an issue that was making incubi much rarer than intended (though they're still pretty rare).  Added some other hidden features, including a preview of 
the second tier of the tech tree.  Fixed an issue preventing a spoiler-related creature, pigeons, and will o' wisps from spawning.  Fixed an issue with 
voidwalker graphics tiles being slightly misaligned.  Slightly brightened voidwalker graphics tiles to make them more visible on dark backgrounds.

[CLE] v0.11c

Fixed a bug preventing damascus sentinels from spawning properly during worldgen.  Tweaked new civilizations - Nephilim are no
longer hostile by default (unless they declare war on you).  Bog Trolls will now send abductors rather than just item thieves.
Names and symbols used by civilizations have been changed.  Dwarven names have been changed for dwarfier epithets.  Bog trolls should now
attack goblins and lizardmen.  Voidwalkers should now attack everything.

[CL9] v0.10a

First public release on Bay12 forums.  Fixed a bug with sentinel core research reaction that was preventing the products from showing up.  Added meowkin
merchant guards.  Tweaked bog troll and voidwalker ethics.  Changed the unpicked color of mousebulb to yellow to differentiate from bluebells (oversight).
Finalized entity lore files.  Tweaked lizardmen to make them show up more often (they were starting in a relatively rare biome not present in all worlds).
Re-introduced ether, which is now produced as an item that must be melted to obtain an ethereal bar (this *should* resolve the caravan problem).  Resolved
an issue with state names of ether.  Tweaked bog trolls to make them show up slightly later.  Made tortoises appear more frequently.  Added preliminary support 
for Phoebus' graphics set.  Support for default (ascii) and Mayday's graphics sets planned.

Ethereal spheres are now produced in batches of ten, as melting was requiring ten of them to produce a single bar.  Getting ten of an item with a 1% chance
of production was ridiculous, so I've adjusted this to make an ethereal sphere production more of an exciting moment.

Syndromes from alchemical reactions now last longer.  While this will not make much of a difference for most reactions, it will make the rare chemical
burns much more dangerous (previously, dwarves were recovering too quickly for the syndrome to cause many problems).

Javelins have been moved to a new building, the metal caster, with associated reactions.

The land mover, a new megabeast, has been added.

Note: Because of difficulties with diplomatic relations, voidwalkers carry the [ITEM_THIEF] token, meaning that a lone voidwalker will periodically show up
(stealthed) and try to steal something.  This is inconsistent with the lore files, which imply that the voidwalkers have nothing to gain from stealing dwarven
stuff, but I needed a token that would force hostilities.  Think of it as the voidwalkers wanting to keep an eye on the other races.

[CL8] v0.07b-e

Internal testing versions.  Too many files modified (and many later reverted) for a list to be terribly helpful.  Changelog will be posted for next version.

--

[CL7] v0.07a

Added the long-overdue graphics for voidwalkers.  Added child graphics to meowkin and lizardmen.  Added two new reactions to alchemy lab.
Pre-production is now complete.  This version will undergo a little more testing before being released as v0.10.

Ether, unfortunately, is showing up in caravans a lot more often than intended.  The importing of large quantities of this metal are limited by its extremely
high value, but seeing every dwarf merchant stride in with an entire company of ethereal spears is detrimental to the mod's intentions and immersion factor.
Until this is resolved, I am removing the ethereal bar from the possible results of alchemical experiments.

Added alchemy and associated files.  Added banshees and will o' wisps.  Added Kipi's block factory (renamed "foundry") and display case.
Added nephilim graphics.  Tweaked a few frequency values for creatures.  Added new noble position and graphics for bog trolls.  Moved a
spoiler-related creature to the creature_easter_egg.txt file (from creature_legendary_narhiril.txt).  Added a spoiler-related new helmet.  
Added graphics for all non-entity creatures.  Removed placeholder graphics for all creatures that used them.

[CL5] v0.05

Fixed a bug with lizardmen and bog trolls that was causing them to die out during worldgen.  Lizardmen can now breathe underwater as well.
Nephilim will now build castles in adventure mode.  Axes and associated graphics have been added to lizardmen and meowkin to allow them to
cut wood for fuel.  Added a new creature, the master of locusts.  Added stones and metal associated with alchemy (will have no effect without
alchemy lab, which will be in the next version).  Updated to compatability with DF v0.31.25.
