UNITS

[U1] EMBERLIGHT WARRIORS (ZALKOR)

Servants of the fire god Zalkor, emberlight warriors are gifted with the power to both create and absorb flames at will.  Emberlight warriors are immune to fire, and can use fire-based 
abilities against their enemies.  Care should be taken to isolate emberlight warriors from the rest of your army, as Zalkor's flames consume both friend and foe alike.
