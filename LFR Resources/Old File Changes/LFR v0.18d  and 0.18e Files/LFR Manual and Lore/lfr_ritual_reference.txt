UNITS

[U1] EMBERLIGHT WARRIORS (ZALKOR)

Servants of the fire god Zalkor, emberlight warriors are gifted with the power to both create and absorb flames at will.  Emberlight warriors are immune to fire, and can use fire-based 
abilities against their enemies.  Care should be taken to isolate emberlight warriors from the rest of your army, as Zalkor's flames consume both friend and foe alike.

Emberlight warriors can throw fireballs, invoke jets of Zalkor's flames, and cause intense pain to their enemies ("mind burn").  Emberlight warriors can also safely swim and walk in magma.


[U3] WAVEBREAKERS (TEMANAT)

Disciples of Temanat, the lady of the waters, wavebreakers are immune to fire, naturally gifted swimmers, and can breathe underwater.  As part of the transformation, wavebreakers grow side and 
dorsal fins.  Wavebreakers have a variety of water and ice-based abilities.

Wavebreakers can throw balls of ice at their enemies, invoke a multi-target ice ball barrage (hailstorm), rust away an opponent's strength, and purify allies of contaminants.  They can also 
fade away into mist to protect themselves from harm.  Wavebreakers can be safely paired with Zalkor's emberlight warriors for a deadly combination.


[U4] STONEKIN (KEROX)

Pledged to serve the goddess of earth, the servants of Kerox recieve immunity to fire and a number of abilities to manipulate the earth to their own beneft or an enemy's disadvantage.  Stonekin 
are tough as nails compared to normal dwarves, and all damage dealt to them with metal or stone weapons is reduced by 10%.

Stonekin can slow enemies by manipulating the earth beneath their feet.  They can churn the earth beneath the feet of enemies in an area to slow them all down for a period of time, or can entomb 
a single enemy for a short time, cutting their movement speed by a whopping 80%.  Stonekin can also boost the toughness of nearby allies with their stone skin ability, and can periodically reduce 
all damage dealt to them by an additional 80% in addition to their natural damage reductio for a very short period of time.  Stonekin can also hurl rocks at their enemies, but this attack has a 
significantly longer cooldown and shorter range than wavebreakers' ice spells.  Stonekin can be safely paired with emberlight warriors, and make excellent "tank" units on the battlefield, buying 
time for their allies to destroy the enemy.


[U5] ZEPHYRS (LEMOX)

Zephyrs are the sworn faithful of Lemox, the goddess of wind.  As part of their ascension, zephyrs grow a small pair of pixie wings on their backs.  While these wings do not allow for flight, they 
imbue the zephyr with some control over the very air around them.  Zephyrs have extremely high natural dodge and ranged combat abilities, as well as agility.

Zephyrs have a small aresenal of spells at their disposal.  They can cast the spells "headwind" and "tailwind" in rapid succession, basically meaning that anywhere a zephyr is present, nearby 
dwarves will move faster and nearby enemies will move slower.  Zephyrs can also imbue allies with a "second wind," granting them immunity to dizziness and dramatically increased agility for a 
short time.  Finally, zephyrs can cause disturbances in the air at will, and are capable of flinging these maelstroms at enemies from an unparalleled distance, even though the actual effect is 
much weaker than other ritual units' projectile attacks.  Because of their range and natural skills, zephyrs make excellent scouts and sentries, and fearsome rangers if given the proper training 
and equipment.  They are not, however, immune to fire, so it's a good idea not to let them anywhere near any emberlight warriors you might have on the battlefield.

If a zephyr loses both of its wings, its powers are greatly reduced.


[U6] TEMPESTS (BARTOTH)

Tempests have been blessed by Bartoth, the orphaned god of lightning.  These units are able to invoke lightning and thunder, and to throw globs of damaging plasma at their enemies.  Tempests are 
exceptional at stunning enemies, and are a great aid when attempting to capture exotic creatures or fight off large groups.  Tempests are frail, however - the effects of lightning running through 
their bodies constantly degrades their muscles, and so tempests are very weak in physical combat.  Care should be taken to protect any tempests in your army from direct combat in order to reap 
the full benefits of Bartoth's power.

Tempests can cause unusual effects when combined with wavebreakers or zephyrs - the powers of Bartoth and Temanat can combine to create a very powerful storm, and the powers of Bartoth and Lemox 
can combine to create extremely powerful winds.  Tempests are not fireproof.

[U8] NIGHTSTALKERS (PHARIS)

In case you're wondering why there isn't a U2, it's because it's classified.  ^_^
