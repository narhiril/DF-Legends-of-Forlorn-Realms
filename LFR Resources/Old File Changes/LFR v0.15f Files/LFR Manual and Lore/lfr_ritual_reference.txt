UNITS

[U1] EMBERLIGHT WARRIORS (ZALKOR)

Servants of the fire god Zalkor, emberlight warriors are gifted with the power to both create and absorb flames at will.  Emberlight warriors are immune to fire, and can use fire-based 
abilities against their enemies.  Care should be taken to isolate emberlight warriors from the rest of your army, as Zalkor's flames consume both friend and foe alike.

Emberlight warriors can throw fireballs, invoke jets of Zalkor's flames, and cause intense pain to their enemies ("mind burn").


[U3] WAVEBREAKERS

Disciples of Temanat, the lady of the waters, wavebreakers are immune to fire, naturally gifted swimmers, and can breathe underwater.  As part of the transformation, wavebreakers grow side and 
dorsal fins.  Wavebreakers have a variety of water and ice-based abilities.

Wavebreakers can throw balls of ice at their enemies, invoke a multi-target ice ball barrage (hailstorm), rust away an opponent's strength, and purify allies of contaminants.  They can also 
fade away into mist to protect themselves from harm.  Wavebreakers can be safely paired with Zalkor's emberlight warriors for a deadly combination.

In case you're wondering why there isn't a U2, it's because it's classified.  ^_^
