[CREATURE:INCUBUS_LFR]
	[DESCRIPTION:Once a race of winged humanoids, the settling of great evils into their homelands, "incubi," as they are now called, were forced to extreme measures.  They survive only by the means of the irreversible sacrifices that they have made through the ages.  Incubi today are feral creatures who know no fear and will attack just about anything on sight.  Though they resemble demons, there is no known relation.  Lesser incubi are the more common variant of these creatures.]
