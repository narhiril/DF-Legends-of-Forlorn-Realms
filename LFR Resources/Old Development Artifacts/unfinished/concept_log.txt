REJECTED (for now)

[DCx] - Lava Gnomes:

"Lava Gnomes" hail from the volcanic, cavernous regions of the world.  They are hostile to the dwarves, whose mining destroys their tunnels, often
without even noticing.  Deep gnomes are a subterranean people who wander the second and third cavern levels.  Their unique ability to hurl balls
of fire at enemies makes them particularly dangerous for creatures of their small size.  Lava gnomes typically travel in small groups.

(reason for rejection: role filled by akuma, further plans for gnomes in the future)
