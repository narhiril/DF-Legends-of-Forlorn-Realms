I felt it important to let you all know that it is, in fact, coming.  It is coming very soon.

What is "it," you ask?

I have been silently working on a very involved expansion mod for some time now, and I am nearing the final stages of pre-production.

Project LFR

[INCLUDED_FEATURES]

With great risk comes great reward.

-Five new civilizations - possibly more down the road.
[spoiler=Civilizations]
*the Meowkin, a slightly demented race of feline humanoids that will sometimes trade with you.
*the Bog Trolls, a large, dangerous and savage race that knows only war.
*the Lizardmen, a paranoid tribal culture that thrives on ambush and guerrilla tactics.
*The Nephilim, a race of flying, angelic humanoids bound by their religion to conquer "lesser" races.  They periodically form alliances.
*another hostile race that is meant to challenge even the most advanced military.
[/spoiler]

-New plants, aimed at filling roles not filled by default plants.  This includes...
[spoiler=Plants]
*colorful plants both above and below ground
*a plant that can be used for just about anything, but has a very low value.
*a hyper-dense tree.
*a plant that produces high-value thread.
*a plant whose alcohol is designed to be used as a bio-weapon.
*a few rare and unusual plants with high values and/or unique properties
*even more!
[/spoiler]

-Six new metals, including new ores and my previously-released mithril.

-New clothing, crafts, and armor types to add diversity to new races.

-Tweaks to two-handed weapons to allow dwarves to wield and manufacture some of them.

-A new, powerful, dwarf-exclusive ranged weapon with three types of ammunition.

-New creatures, including ...
[spoiler=Creatures]
*the wyvern, a flying subspecies of dragon.
*the leviathan, a terrifying creature of the deep ocean.
*the devourer, a deep cavern spider ten times the size of the GCS that avoids traps and rips limbs from bodies.  Its silk is precious.
*the deep wolf, a creature that attacks in enormous swarms.
*the damascus sentinel, a mechanical construct of an ancient civilization long since gone from the world.
*the tortoise, a harmless above-ground creature that is a breeding source of shells.
*the pegasus, a winged horse (raws and graphics by elf-fondling human) that thrives in good biomes.
*even more legendary creatures and megabeasts, some of which have some very unique properties (more in-depth descriptions in the manual).
[/spoiler]

-A painstakingly written new language file.

-Over sixty new types of weapon.
[spoiler=Weapons]
Yeah, that's right.  SIXTY.  But Narhiril, how the hell am I going to manage sixty more weapon types in my stockpiles?  The simple answer is, you don't have to.  
Of these 60+ weapons, only about 10 are actually used by existing and new civilizations.  The rest are there for one reason - artifacts.  When you get a weaponsmith in a strange mood with my mod, you have no idea what you're going to get.  Maybe you'll get a boring old sword or axe, or maybe you'll get "Blacktemples, a mithril khopesh," or "Hauntedrazor, a damascus steel pair of bladed chains."  Legendary weapons should be legendary.  Your civilization will be known forever for the weapon it creates, which will truly be one-of-a-kind.  And yes, some of these weapons are obscenely powerful - but believe me, you'll need them.
[/spoiler]

-Three new buildings, including the alchemy lab, foundry (raws by Kipi), and display case (raws also by Kipi).

-Graphics support for Ironhand's graphics pack, and new graphics created specifically for this mod by myself.

-Extensive personally-written lore files.

-An incredibly detailed manual on 95% of new features - I didn't want to give EVERYTHING away ;)

-Modular file structure.  If you don't want the graphics, don't include them.  If you don't like a new civilization, simply remove them.  File names are similar enough to default raws for easy navigation, but different enough to be obvious which files are mod-related.
