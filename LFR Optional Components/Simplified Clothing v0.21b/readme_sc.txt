This is the "Simplified Clothing" plug-in component for LFR.  

It is fully compatable with LFR v0.21b and should not be used with any version prior to this.

"LFR-SC" is an optional component for use alongside LFR.  It vastly reduces the amount of clothing options to all civilizations to one or two items.  It is designed to
maximize framerate and minimize clutter from battle for those who so desire.  This component does not remove any of the stock or LFR-related articles of clothing, it
simply adds a few "generic" articles and rewrites the permissions.  As a result, artifact clothing will be unaffected by this plug-in.  You will still get the periodic
fully functional artifact sock, even though socks are not normally present while using this component.  I have attempted to find a balance between optimization and
preservation of DF's hallmark feature of absurd artifact creation.

Expect updates for this component to accompany LFR releases from this point forward.

INSTALLATION:

Simply place the contents of the included "raw" folder into your DF/raw directory.  You should overwrite the files that are in conflict.

You will need to generate a new world before you see LFR-SC's changes take full effect.
